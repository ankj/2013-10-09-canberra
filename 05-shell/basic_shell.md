# Using the shell to do more in less time
**What is the shell?**

The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the operating system to carry out. 

All Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash. There are other kinds that can be installed in different operating systems.

Before we talk more, let's actually open the shell on your operating system.

My shell prompt looks like this:

![](shell_prompt.png)

Yours might looks different (these can be easily customized). Usually includes something like `username@machinename`, followed by the current working directory (more about that soon) and a $ sign

## Entering commands into the shell

You can just enter commands directly into the shell.

```
echo Morning Canberra
```

We just used a command called `echo` and gave it an argument called `Morning Canberra`.

If you enter a command that shell doesn't recognize, it will just report an error

```
$ gobbeltdfsf
bash: gobbeltdfsf: command not found
```

Now let's enter something useful. Let's navigate to the Desktop of your computer (more on navigation very shortly)

```
cd ~
pwd
```

What does it say?

OK, now let's type in a really useful (and for today a rather important) shell command (*PS: No need to run this if you've successfully done it already.*)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/swcarpentry/2013-10-09-canberra
```

## How commands work in the shell

Commands are often followed by one or more options that modify their behavior, and further, by one or more arguments, the items upon which the command acts. So most commands look kind of like this:

```
e.g. ls -l ~/
```

```
command -option arguments
```



## Knowing where you are and seeing whats around

The first thing you want to do when you're somewhere new is get a map or figure out how to obtain directions. Since you're new to the shell, we're going to do just that.

Three really imporant commands:

* `pwd` *Acronym for print working directory*. Tell you where you are.  
* `cd` *Change directory*. Give it options for where to take you.  
* `ls` *Short for list*. List all the files and folders in your current location.  

Most operating systems have a hierarchical directory structure. The very top is called the `root directory`. It contains files, subfolders and so on. Everything else is nested below.


```
$ pwd
/Users/karthik
```

Note that I'm in my HOME directory. Yours should (hopefully) look different. 


**List all the files in this directory**

```
$ ls
Applications    Documents   Dropbox     Library     Music       Public      Desktop     Downloads         Movies      Pictures  
```
You can change the working directory at any time using the `cd` command.

```
cd /usr/bin 
pwd 
ls
```
Now change back to your home again

```
cd ~
```

Tip: `~` is a shortcut for the HOME directory for any user. My home is `/users/karthik` and I can get there two ways:

`cd /users/karthik` OR `cd ~`.

**Full versus relative paths**

In the command line you can use both full paths (much like someone's street address with post code) OR offer relative directions from one's current location. You can do the same here.

```
cd /usr
pwd
```

We're now in the `usr/` directory. Now change to `bin`/

```
cd bin
```

This is the same as doing:

```
cd /usr/bin
```

from **anywhere**.

Tip: Just plain `cd` with no options should take you back home. Try it. `cd` to some place else and type in `cd` again.


**Quick exercise 01**

1. Change into your HOME (or wherever you downloaded the 2013-10-09-canberra folder). Then into `shell`. List the contents of this folder. Then change back into your home again.

## Exploring your file system

Three really important commands

* `ls`
* `file`
* `less`

`ls` is extremely useful both for beginners and experts. `ls` can not only list the current directory contents but also contents from anywhere without changing working directories.

e.g.

```
ls /usr
```

or even multiple directories at once

```
ls ~ /usr
```

Now we can start adding more options. Recall that commands can take both options (with a `-`) followed by arguments. Let's add some to ls. 

```
cd boot-camps
ls -l
karthik:boot-camps/ (2013-09-bristol*) $ ls -l
total 13944
-rwxr-xr-x   1 karthik  staff  3772928 Sep 12 05:16 Conclusion.ppt

drwxr-xr-x   7 karthik  staff      238 Sep 12 05:15 version-control
```

By adding “-l” to the command, we changed the output to the long format.

Now let's add more options

```
ls -lt
```

The `t` options now sorts by time.

Similarly you can try the following:

| Option | What it does |
| ------ | ----------- |
| -a | List all files even those that are hidden. Files starting with a `.` are considered hidden |
| -d | Only directories | 
| -F | All a trailing slash to help identify folders | 
| -h | Make file sizes human readable | 
| -l | Long format | 
| -S | Sort by file size | 
| -t | Sort by modification time | 

Try some of these. Do you see any new files that we have not discussed before? You can even combine several of these options in a single command.

What are all the extra fields in the long format?

```
$ ls -l
total 13944

```
* Files begin with a `-` and directories with a `d`.  
* Followed by permissions for the user, group, and everyone.   
* Permissions are in the order of read, write, and execute. If any * group is missing a permission, you'll see a `-`.  
* Ignore field 3 for now (it's the number of links to the file)  
* The owner of the file  
* What group this person belongs to  
* Size of file in bytes  (Quick question: How do you change this?)  
* Date an time the file was last modified  
* Name of file.  

**Determining file type**

```
file <filename>
```

e.g.

```
file Location.md
Location.md: ASCII English text
```

Examine files with the `less` command. Keeps the content from scrolling of the screen. You can also use the arrow keys to navigate up or down. Press enter to keep scrolling down and the `q` key to quit. 

**Quick exercise 02**

1. cd `HOME`
2. cd into `boot-camps` 
3. cd into a given directory
4. List directory contents with `ls -l`
5. Pick any file that looks interesting to you
6. find out what it is using `file`
7. then view it's contents using `less`

**Tab completion**

Bash and most other shell programs have tab completion. This means that you can begin typing in a command name or file name and just hit tab to complete entering the text. If there are multiple matches, the shell will show you all available options.

```
cd
cd 2013<tab>
```

What just happened?

Try pressing `s`, then hitting tab?

When you hit the first `tab`, nothing happens. The reason is that there are multiple directories in the home directory which start with `s`. Thus, the shell does not know which one to fill in. When you hit `tab` again, the shell will list the possible choices.

Tab completion can also fill in the names of programs. For example, enter `e<tab><tab>`. You will see the name of every program that starts with an e. One of those is echo. If you enter `ech<tab>`` you will see that `tab` completion works.

**Command history**

The shell typically stores your most recent commands. View them by using the up and down arrow keys.  Typing in `history` is a great way to get a full list. Execute any (especially long commands) by referencing it with a `!`.

example: `!500` will execute line 500 from your history.


**Wildcards**

One of the biggest reasons using shell is faster than ever using a GUI file manager is that it allows for wildcards. There are special characters known as wildcards. They allow you to select files based on patterns of characters.

| Wildcard | what it means |
| -------  | -----------  | 
| * |  Matches any character | 
| ? |  Matches any single character | 
| [characters] |  Matches any character in this set | 
| ![characters] |  Matches any character NOT in this set |





**Short exercise 01**

Do each of the following using a single `ls` command without navigating to a different directory.

List all of the files in `/bin` that start with the letter `c`  
List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter `a`  
List all of the files in `/bin` that end in `o`  
BONUS: List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter `a`   or the letter `t`  


## Manipulating the file system

Make directories with `mkdir`

```
mkdir directory_name
```

You can create as many folders as you like in a single call.

```
mkdir directory_name_1 directory_name_2 directory_name_3
```

Copy files with `cp`

```
cp file1 file2
```

Move files with `mv`

```
mv file1 file2
```

See the `man` command to get help on options you can use with these commands.

Remove files with `rm`

***Warning: The shell does not have a recycling bin. So any file removed with `rm` is gone forever. Use with caution.***

## Let's try out some of the commands above

First go home `cd`.  
Next create a temporary directory.


```
mkdir scratchpad
cd scratchpad
```

Make a few directories

```
mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3  
cp /etc/passwd .
```

```
ls -l
```

You can also create an entire directory structure with a single call. e.g.

```
mkdir temp
cd temp
mkdir -p project/{data,R,inst/{doc,tests,manuscript},src}
```
This will create a project called root with the following structure:

```
├── R
├── data
├── inst
│   ├── doc
│   ├── manuscript
│   └── tests
└── src
```

Create lots of subdirectories at once using brace expansions.

```
echo Experiment-{A,B,C}-master
echo {01..15}
# nest these patterns
echo a{A{1,2},B{3,4}}b
```


```
mkdir temp
cd temp
ls
mkdir dir-{0..10}
ls
```


## Command History

You can easily access previous commands.  Hit the up arrow.
Hit it again.  You can step backwards through your command history.
The down arrow takes your forwards in the command history.

^-C will cancel the command you are writing, and give you a fresh prompt.

^-R will do a reverse-search through your command history.  This
is very useful.

You can also review your recent commands with the `history` command.  Just enter:

    history

to see a numbered list of recent commands, including this just issues
`history` command.  You can reuse one of these commands directly by
referring to the number of that command.

If your history looked like this:

    259  ls *!
    260  ls boot-camp
    261  git add .

then you could repeat command #260 by simply entering:

    !260

(that's an exclamation mark).



# Getting help

* If you're not sure where a program is located, use `which`

e.g.

```
which git
``` 

* See the manual for any program with `man <program_name>`  
* Get help on a command with `<program_name> --help`  



## Short exercise 2

cd into a folder under `shell` called `messy-folder`.  
Then create three directories: `data`, `notes`, `images`.  
Then move the respective file types into their matching folder type.Go back to the main shell folder.
Rename (it's the same as mv command) `messy-folder` to `clean-folder`.

Hints: You can combine several steps into one. Tab completion and wildcards are your friends.
